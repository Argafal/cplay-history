Description:

        cplay is a curses front-end for various audio players. It aims
        to provide a power-user-friendly interface with simple filelist
        and playlist control. cplay is written in Python and can use
        either pyncurses or the standard curses module.

Requirements:

        - cplay                 http://www.tf.hut.fi/~flu/cplay/
        - python                http://www.python.org/
        - mpg321    (optional)  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpg321/

Installation:

        make install

Usage:

        cplay [-rRv] [ file | dir | playlist ] ...

        When in doubt, press 'h' for a friendly help page.

Miscellaneous:

        If you would like to change options passed to the actual
        players just edit the PLAYERS list in the cplay script.

        A playlist can contain URLs, but the playlist itself will
        have to be local. For mpeg streaming, splay is recommended.

        It is also possible to pipe a playlist to cplay, as stdin
        will be reopened on startup unless it is attached to a tty.

        Remote control via /var/tmp/cplay_control; see lircrc.
