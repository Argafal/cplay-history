TODO
------------------------------------------
5 - document <, >
x - wma (mplayer?)
x - replace current playlist (useful when streaming?)
x - browse bookmarks?
x - use "file" to both get mime and bitrate info?
x - backspace does not work on gentoo?
x - index-mode: group/sort/search by ctime, filename, metadata, etc.
x - screen title patch
x - expand 2 or more dirs mode for filelist?
x - musepack
x - don't require both ID3 and pyogg for one of them to work
x ? title/status realtime only from playlist
x - progress bar not always reset?
x - call update_status() from poll()
x - get_tag() is messy
x - don't try to write m3u to search results path
x - shell from playlist?
3 - incremental filter command 'f' like *amp 'j'
2 - show alternatives in filelist for ambiguous completion?
1 - :commands?
x - macros / bind user commands
2 - optionally show all files in a dir
3 - center current line (requires one-line scrolling)
x - shell prompt could show number of args? (tagged entries)
x ? change cwd for shell commands (what about "search results"!?)
x - embed search command in pathname to view in filelist? (bookmark results)
    - /path/name?search=args or /path/name?index=args
    - will allow bookmarks, except for refined searches?
x - command-line history? (now cursor-up cancels)
x - index based on metadata database (manual update and batch cplay -u dir?)
x - virtual index-dirs
x - persistence: save state on exit?
x - save current config to conf/rc file?
x - delete playlist entries is too slow
    - try creating a new list from non-tagged items?
x - rename/rethink app.kludge
x - replace help window with generic show file window (move help -> file)
x - shuffle & sort tagged entries only?
x - searching for empty string not currently possible with /
x - make isearch use regexes?
x - make could compile and run a small program that figures out
    ioctl numbers on different OS/architectures.
x - sanity check: (pause or stopped) and seek => play?
x - add status message for unbound keys / commands
x - use >, < to scroll window sideways?
x - number of dirs to hide in vp_pathname. change with >, <
x - use reverse logic: number of parent dirs to show with >, <
    .. makes pathname viewpoint obsolete?
x - search/tag regex/... on str(entry) or entry.vp() ?
1 - use & for delayed commands?
2 - wait 0.5s between subsequent next/prev. NOT before starting player!
    .. or pause current player immediately on next/prec commands?
    .. compare with repeating enter?
3 - rc-file with
    1. player configs
    2. metadata viewpoint format
    3. pathname viewpoint number of dirs to show (command also?)
    4. persistent bookmarks
3 - enter opens m3u as virtual dir in filelist
3 - support midi players
3 - support flac (command line player?)
x - support xmms?
3 - better madplay support
4 - restricted mode (disable bang)
4 - pls-playlist TITLE support
3 - programmable delay between songs (useful for MD synchronized recording)
0 - improve isearch using bookmarks for previous position?
4 - error msg when following broken links?
4 - don't block on slow commands (eg. listdir / add dir / recursive search)
3 - better input support (readline?)
2 - fast Esc (not possible with keypad?)
2 - hide cursor after SUSP & CONT cycle
4 - metadata info page
4 ? chdir(..) should behave like Backspace
4 - try small screen layout patch
2 - check against old ogg.and.mp3.info.patch for missing features
3 - use i to toggle *info window?
5 - recursive search should save bufptr of prev dir
4 - revert sorting change -> always sort according to viewpoint
3 - clean up app.player.is_stopped() mess
2 - which -> WHICH (upcase global functions?)
3 - howto select player for streaming http://ip:port urls?


misc thoughts
------------------------------------------
- fork and exec /bin/sh and select on pipe for command completion?
- use C as a shortcut for untag/clear all?
- suspend + resize + continue -> should resize
- rc-file
- sort search results
- magic
- dynamic help page?
- toggle header / small screen mode (treshold?)
- randomly play albums (groups / hierarchical playlist)
- delwin before/in/after resize?
- different marks/tags for filelist and playlist?
- dust off id3 patch?
- dust off cddb patch?
- filtered point of view (obsoleted by recursive searching?)
- mark filelist entries already in playlist
- support cd-players
- sideways scrolling?
- alternative scrolling method
- metadata editor?
- reread dir => search for current entry
- support alsaplayer, xmp, others?
- delayed play or mark as next command (play after current is finished)
- use 'N' to mark as next?
- reset progress when changing song? (what?)
- restore xterm title (not possible with aterm, rxvt, etc?)
- mpg123 gives jumpy progress info for vbr files (averaging filter?)
- should there be another way to start playing the playlist
  from the beginning than "next track"? (and Tab+Enter)
- new and more vi-friendly keymap
- numerical arguments?
- n and N could correspond to next and previous
- f and b could select next and previous track?
- a/A = Append mp3/dir
- i/I = Insert mp3/dir
- Meta-<, Meta-> commands? (avoid meta)
- show progress-counter while streaming?
- support slang?
- fade in/out mode? (a la repeat/random)
- crossfade mode (hardly)
- is Enter and cursor position logical / intuitive? (absolutely)
