misc thoughts
------------------------------------------
- delete files? (avoid filemanager-bloat)
- support alsaplayer, xmp, others?
- delayed play command (play after current song is finished)
- reset progress when changing song?
- restore xterm title (not possible with aterm, rxvt, etc?)
- mpg123 gives buggy progress info for some mp3 files
- should there be another way to start playing the playlist
  from the beginning than "next track"?
- / and ? should search
- n and N should correspond to next and previous
- f and b could select next and previous track?
- a/A = Append mp3/dir
- i/I = Insert mp3/dir
- t/T = tag current/regex
- u/U = untag current/regex
- Meta-<, Meta-> commands?
- treat .m3u files as directories?
- show progress while streaming?
- Python 1.4 compatibility?
- support slang?
- icecast/shoutcast support
- fade in/out mode (a la repeat/random)
- filtered or narrowed view (based on glob / regex)
- Enter and cursor position logical / intuitive?
- lots of suggestions from Chris Liechti
