misc thoughts
------------------------------------------
- delayed play command (play after current song is finished)
- restore xterm title (not possible with aterm, rxvt, etc?)
- mpg123 gives buggy progress info for some mp3 files
- should there be another way to start playing the playlist
  from the beginning than "next track"?
- / and ? should search
- n and N should correspond to next and previous
- f and b should choose next and previous track?
- treat .m3u files as directories?
- support slang?
- show progress while streaming?
